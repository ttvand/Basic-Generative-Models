# Basic Generative Models using Keras on MNIST
This repository contains some starter code to train and inspect basic generative models. Keras is used to model the classic MNIST data set.

There is a separate folder for Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).

Both generative model folders consist of a main file and a utilities file. All hyperparameters, training and inspection logic is located in a concise main file with all additional logic in the utilities file.

Both models also allow basic conditional encoding/decoding and generation/discrimination of MNIST digits.
